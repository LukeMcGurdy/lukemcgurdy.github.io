        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>"What's all this about, then?", you may ask. Well this is my site. It's where I expermient with web technologies that are new or new to me. So expect things to break from time to time (or always if you are using anything below IE10). For example, this site is hosted on github, is built with Jekyll, and uses HTML, SCSS, jQuery, flexbox (in parts) and utilizes my own simple grid system. Some of these I get to use professionally, while others are completely new to me.</p>
        <p>At this point I would direct you to my Groundbreaking Projects section but as that doesn't exist yet there probably isn't much point. So I'll direct you instead to my Bog Standard Projects section. Unfortunately, I haven't quite got round to starting it.</p>
        <p>I think now would be a good point to mention that this entire site is a work in progress.</p>
