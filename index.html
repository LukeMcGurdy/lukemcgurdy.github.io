        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>"What's all this, then?", you may ask. Well this is my site. It's where I experiment with web technologies that range from the familiar to the unfamiliar. For example, this site is hosted on github, is built in Jekyll, uses HTML, SCSS, jQuery, flexbox (in parts) and utilizes my own simple grid system. About half of these I get to use professionally, while the remainder is completely new to me. So expect things to break from time to time (or always if you are using anything below IE10).</p>
        <p>This entire site is a work in progress and probalbly will be as long as I maintain it.</p>
