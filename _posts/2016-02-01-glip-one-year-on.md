# Glip - one year on

In a previous blog entry I talked about Glip. At the time of writing the original post it was just a few days into an experiment in which our company transition from using Slack to Glip. But now a year has passed and I think I'm in a better position to share some thoughts on how this went.

When assessing Glip the question I ask myself is how works in a company of about 25 people, with about half of those using it on a daily basis. The short answer is it works very well. And yet there are a couple of caveats that go along with this endorsement.

The pace of development appears to fluctuate between slow and non existent.
