I've just push all my umcompleted work to Git. The result was that my previously boring but (some what) functioning site has been replaced by an incomplete and totally broken site. It's a mess.

Why do this? Well, I've been busy procrasinating of late and this is my penance. I need a good hoof up the arse and I figure that airing my dirty laundy in public is as good a motivation as any to get things in order.

For posterity here is the old abomination:
