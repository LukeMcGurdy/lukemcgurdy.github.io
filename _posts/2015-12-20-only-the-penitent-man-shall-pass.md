# Only the penitent man shall pass

I've just pushed all the incomplete work for this poor neglected site to my GiHub repo. The result was that my previously boring but somewhat functioning site has been replaced by a broken site - at least if viewed in lte IE 11, Safari 8, iPhone and so on. It's a long list.

Why do this? Well, I've been busy procrastinating of late and this is my penance. I need a good kick up the arse and I figure that airing my dirty laundry in public is as good a motivation as any to get things in order. Expect updates right after I wake from my Christmas dinner food coma or whatever time the unrelentingly grim Easternders Christmas omnibus comes on the TV. And now back to watching Indiana Jones.

For posterity here is the old abomination:
