#Only the penitent man shall pass

I've just pushed all the incomplete work for this poor neglected site to Git. The result was that my previously boring but (some what) functioning site has been replaced by a broken site - at least if viewed in lte IE 11, Safari 8, iPhone and so on (the list is long). It's a mess. 

Why do this? Well, I've been busy procrasinating of late and this is my penance. I need a good kick up the arse and I figure that airing my dirty laundy in public is as good a motivation as any to get things in order. Expect updates right after I wake from my post Chrismas dinner food coma and/ or whatever time the uniquely grim Easternders Christmas omnibus comes on the TV.

For posterity here is the old abomination:
