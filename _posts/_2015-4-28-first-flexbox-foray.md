My solitary goal behind this site is simple - to try out new technology. That I may occasionally produce bad post titles for the sake of illiteration or write semi-coherent posts are really only unfortunate by-products of this goal.

One thing on my 'give-it-a-go' list is flexbox. With browser support limited to the <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox" target="_blank">latest browsers</a> there has been no reason for me to use it professionally. And on a personal level I've had bigger fish to fry. Besides all this, I still like floating and clearing elements. It might be a weird and hakish technique, but it's opne that I understand well enough to be able to create sites.

As I continue to develop this site flexbox will be used in on a limited basis. So far the plan is to use it for the layout of the blog landing page, and my initial thoughts are that it will look a little something like <a href="http://codepen.io/anon/pen/QbwVor" target="_blank">this</a> (where 1 is the latest blog post).

For anyone interested in finding out about flexbox (e.g. what it is and how to use it) then CSS-Tricks has a fantastic <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">guide</a> on all thisgs flex.

Long and short - flexbox is a layout module that will become increasingly relevant, just as floats will become less relevant. (This said, I don't think floats are going away entirely any time soon.) So if you are looking at what is coming down the pike in the near future (or "coming down the pipe" as some say) then flexbox is it. Actually, if you are't concerned with IE before 10 or 11 then the future is now!
